Temperature Check script using Raspberry Pi with AM2302

## Project Description

This is a project I put together to make a cheap temperature check for a server rack.  I know there are products available that do this, like the awesome Supergoose, but honestly those are overkill for this.  

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 3b
- SD Card
- Power Supply
- [Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072LXCWSS)
- [AM2302 Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensore Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018JO5BRK)
 
Honestly you could use a Raspberry Pi v1 for this, I just happened to have a box of 3b units available and wanted to use them for something.The case can be whatever suits your need best.  The AM2302 I used is linked to, but you could use any AM2302 that is equivelant to the [one offered by Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/393).
